This repository contains my minimal-maintenance conference tracker
and an opinionated list of CS conferences.
I find this slightly easier than keeping the dates on Google Calendar
because I can glance at the entire list, keep track of URLs,
and add reminders when I need to add next year's conference.

# Project Structure
The Python source in [report.py](report.py) generates a plaintext
report from the [YAML data](./data).
I have a [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job send
weekly emails with [email-report.sh](email-report.sh)
and [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/).

# Adding and Updating Data
As conferences pass and the data becomes outdated,
I'm happy to accept pull requests with updated data.
If you want to track yours by adding/removing conferences,
please fork this repo.
